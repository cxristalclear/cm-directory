## 🗄️ Database Setup

### 1. Create Admin User

First, create an admin user in Supabase:

```sql
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
-- Click "Add User"
-- Email: your-admin@example.com
-- Password: [secure password]
-- Email Confirm: Check this box to auto-confirm
```

### 2. Verify Database Schema

Your database should already have these tables based on your uploaded schema:
- `companies` - Main company data
- `facilities` - Company locations
- `capabilities` - Manufacturing capabilities
- `industries` - Industries served
- `certifications` - Company certifications
- `technical_specs` - Technical specifications
- `business_info` - Business information
- `company_change_log` - Change tracking

### 3. Create Missing Tables (if needed)

If you don't have the `company_change_log` table yet, create it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS company_change_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  company_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  changed_by_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  changed_by_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  changed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  change_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (change_type IN ('created', 'claimed', 'updated', 'verified', 'approved', 'rejected')),
  field_name TEXT,
  old_value TEXT,
  new_value TEXT,
  change_summary JSONB,
  reviewed_by TEXT,
  review_notes TEXT,
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_company_change_log_company_id ON company_change_log(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_company_change_log_changed_at ON company_change_log(changed_at DESC);
```

### 4. Update Companies Table (if needed)

Make sure your companies table has these fields for claims and verification:

```sql
ALTER TABLE companies 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claim_status TEXT DEFAULT 'unclaimed' CHECK (claim_status IN ('unclaimed', 'pending_review', 'claimed', 'rejected')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claimed_by_email TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claimed_by_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claimed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claim_approved_by TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claim_approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claim_rejection_reason TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS verified_by TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS verified_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS verified_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_pending_updates BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_reviewed_by TEXT;
```

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 🧭 Admin Task Guidelines

- Always rely on the generated Supabase types in `lib/database.types.ts` when shaping payloads for admin updates. They mirror the database schema and prevent drift across forms and audit helpers.
- Before marking an admin dashboard task complete, run `npm run lint` and `tsc --noEmit` to ensure the UI passes linting and type checks against the latest Supabase definitions.

### 1. Copy All Files

Copy all the created files to your project, maintaining the directory structure shown above.

### 2. Update Your Root Layout

Add the Toaster component to your root layout (`app/layout.tsx`):

```tsx
import { Toaster } from 'sonner'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <Toaster position="top-right" />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### 3. Update Supabase Client

Make sure your `lib/supabase.ts` exports both client and server clients. You may need to update it:

```tsx
import { createClientComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
import { createServerComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

export const createClient = () => createClientComponentClient()
export const createServerClient = () => createServerComponentClient({ cookies })
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Ensure these are in your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Access the Admin Dashboard

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`

Login with your admin credentials.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all packages are installed
- Clear `.next` folder and restart dev server: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### Authentication issues
- Verify admin user exists in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Check browser console for Supabase errors

### Database errors
- Verify all tables exist in Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor
- Check RLS (Row Level Security) policies if queries fail
- For initial setup, you may need to disable RLS or create appropriate policies

### Type errors
- Make sure all type definition files are in place
- Run `npm run build` to check for TypeScript errors
- Check that imports match your project structure

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Row Level Security (RLS)

For production, you should enable RLS on your tables. Here are example policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated admin users to manage companies
CREATE POLICY "Admin can manage companies" ON companies
FOR ALL USING (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Similar policies for other tables
CREATE POLICY "Admin can manage facilities" ON facilities
FOR ALL USING (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Repeat for: capabilities, industries, certifications, technical_specs, business_info, company_change_log
```

### Admin Role

For more advanced security, create an admin role:

```sql
-- Create admin role in Supabase
-- Then update policies to check for admin role
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can manage companies" ON companies
FOR ALL USING (
  auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin'
);
```
