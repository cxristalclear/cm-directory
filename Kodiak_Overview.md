# Kodiak Assembly Solutions – Knowledge Sheet

## Company Snapshot
- **Business name:** Kodiak Assembly Solutions
- **Website:** `https://kodiakassembly.com`
- **Headquarters:** Austin, Texas
- **Certifications:** ISO 9001:2015, ITAR registered
- **Core offering:** U.S.-based electronics manufacturing services (turnkey sourcing, PCB assembly, box build/system integration, comprehensive testing).

## Ideal Customer Profile
1. OEMs and product companies that design and sell their own electronic devices or systems but prefer a collaborative U.S. EMS partner for PCB assemblies, integrated builds, and DFM/DFT/test support.
2. Geographic priority: Austin first, Texas second, U.S. nationwide third. International fits are evaluated when logistics make sense.
3. Typically <500 employees (can be larger) and not fully vertically integrated—open to outsourcing prototypes through production.
4. Product domains: industrial controls, instrumentation, energy management, HVAC/refrigeration, utilities/water, oil & gas, battery systems, renewables/solar, space/defense, security/access control, communications/networking/RF/GNSS/IoT, telemetry, robotics/automation, commercial equipment, vending/payment, medical/wellness electronics, consumer/connected devices, control/sensing modules, gateways, BMS, embedded computers, HMI, and related subassemblies.

## Pain Points by Function
- **Product teams:** Difficulty aligning features with manufacturability, long timelines due to testing/regulatory gates, late-stage design changes, limited prototype options that scale, pressure to manage multiple variants.
- **Operations:** Production delays from missing parts or slow supplier feedback, inconsistent quality/traceability with offshore partners, limited visibility into mixed-volume builds, bottlenecks during ramps or build switches.
- **Supply chain & sourcing:** Need a single partner for PCB assembly + testing + integration, long lead times/EOL risk on critical components, minimal visibility into material status, compliance uncertainty with regulated builds.
- **Engineering:** Bandwidth split between design and production support, integration issues across sensors/RF/power/mechanical elements, late discovery of signal integrity or thermal problems, limited support for fast iteration and validation, version-control friction.
- **Quality & compliance:** Audit risk from documentation gaps, inconsistent inspection/test practices, extra prep for customer/regulatory audits, escapes due to insufficient coverage, need disciplined records for regulated products.

## Desired Customer Outcomes
1. Smooth progression from prototype to production without surprises or redesigns.
2. Real-time insight into material status, inventory, and build progress.
3. Reliable cycle times with predictable output volume.
4. Single, trusted partner handling sourcing, PCB assembly, testing, and integration.
5. Fewer field failures, rework incidents, and scrap.
6. Rapid, transparent issue response (failures, yield drops, component changes).
7. Leaner inventory positions due to proactive materials planning.
8. Audit-ready processes and documentation.

## Value Proposition
Kodiak unifies turnkey sourcing (SyteLine ERP), PCB assembly, box build, system integration, and advanced testing (3D AOI, 2D X-ray, flying probe, functional, customer-supplied fixtures). DFM/DFT support is included during NPI and production. ISO 9001:2015 and ITAR discipline keeps customers in control of parts, builds, and quality while they scale across versions and volumes.

## Customer Guarantees
1. **On-time delivery:** 97% of orders ship on the committed date once design is approved and materials are on site.
2. **Build accuracy & quality:** Assemblies meet specifications and pass inspection/testing before shipment; Kodiak absorbs costs for defects spotted pre-ship.
3. **Issue response:** Initial reply within 1 business day, corrective plan within 5 business days, status updates as issues resolve.
4. **Design support & flexibility:** Early design reviews with actionable improvements; support for design changes prior to final build freeze.
5. **Material reliability:** Syteline-driven materials management with proactive alerts on shortages or substitution needs.

## Core Capabilities
1. Turnkey EMS from NPI through low-, mid-, and high-volume high-mix production.
2. SMT and mixed-technology assembly in both RoHS and Sn/Pb; conformal coating, DI water wash.
3. Material planning and traceability within SyteLine ERP (supports turnkey, consigned, and hybrid models with stock-to-dock visibility).
4. Test coverage: 3D AOI, 2D X-ray, flying probe, functional test, firmware programming, custom or customer-supplied fixtures, yield improvement support.
5. Box build and system integration performed in-house with dedicated mechanical assembly space and system-level test capability.
6. Engineering team provides DFM/DFT guidance during NPI to de-risk ramps and sustain quality.
7. Quality infrastructure anchored by ISO 9001:2015 certification and ITAR compliance.

## Pricing Approach
1. **Non-recurring:** Stencils (top/bottom), SMT programming, PCB tooling, test development.
2. **Lot charges:** Setup per build release plus material handling.
3. **Recurring unit pricing:** Quantity-driven, incorporating labor, material cost per board, and material burden.
4. **Test & inspection:** AOI, flying probe, functional, and custom fixtures priced per required coverage/complexity.
5. **Conformal coating:** Charged per board based on chemistry and masking needs.
6. **Box build/system integration:** Priced as additions to base assembly scope.
